## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- How to configure image as background
```css
body {
  background-image: url('./images/pattern-background-[mobile/desktop].svg');
  background-size: contain;  /* Scales the image as large as possible
                                within its container without cropping
                                or stretching the image.*/
  background-repeat : no-repeat;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN - background size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) - This helped me for setting background size.
